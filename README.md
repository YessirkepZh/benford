# The BenApp
### An app for exploring Benford's Law

This app is written in Vue.js, Python, and Flask. It lets a user pick a column from a data set and compare the numerical distribution against [Benford's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benford's_law).

A demo of this app is available on [VueToots](http://www.vuetoots.com/).

If you want to run the app locally, a *Dockerfile* has been included. The container will run the app on a Flask development server from the container's port 80.
